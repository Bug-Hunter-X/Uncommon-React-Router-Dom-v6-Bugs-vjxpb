# Uncommon React Router Dom v6 Bugs
This repository demonstrates and provides solutions for some less common but potentially problematic bugs encountered when using React Router Dom v6.  These issues go beyond the typical 'not found' errors and involve nuanced aspects of route definition and usage.

The repository includes two files:

- `bug.js`: Shows examples of the problematic code.
- `bugSolution.js`: Provides the corrected implementations and explains the fixes.

The focus is on:

- Missing `<BrowserRouter>` wrapper.
- Incorrect usage of `useParams`.
- Problems stemming from improperly nested routes.
- Forgetting to export the `Routes` component.
