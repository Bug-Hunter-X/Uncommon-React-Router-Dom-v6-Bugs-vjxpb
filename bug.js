In React Router Dom v6, a common error is using `<Routes>` without a surrounding `<BrowserRouter>`. This results in the routes not rendering correctly, leading to a blank page or unexpected behavior.  Another issue is incorrect usage of the `useParams` hook, resulting in `undefined` values. Improperly nested routes can also cause routing problems, resulting in unexpected route matches. For example, a route `/users/:id` could unintentionally match `/users/123/profile` if not nested correctly. Finally, forgetting to export `Routes` after defining them can lead to rendering errors.
